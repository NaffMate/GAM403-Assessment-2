# GAM403-Assessment-2
Github Repository for my game 'The Growth of Samuel'


Currently a lot of the mechanics included do not actually work.
Upon planning this game my eagerness got ahead of me and took way too much work on.
Not that it helped that stuff that should be finished just doesn't work.
There is no death screen so the last obstacle (orange block after jumping off the last platform),
SHOULD, just reset the level just like jumping off the map should.

Tutorial(s) used (probably outdated, hence why a lot of my stuff doesn't work)

I did use a few more tutorials and forum posts but removed all of the other mechanics due to not working
so didn't think it necessary.
